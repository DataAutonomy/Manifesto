# The Data Autonomy Manifesto

We claim back what is ours! We claim sovereignty over our data. We demand every
entity that collects data about us to grant us the three powers that are
necessary to achieve Data Autonomy:

## The Power of Knowledge

We have the right to know what data exists about us.

Every entity that collects data about us has to inform us of that fact. They
also have to inform us what data is collected and about the purpose
of this endeavor.

## The Power of Access

We have the right to access our data.

If data is stored about us or by us we have the irrevocable right to access it.
Every service that accepts our data or collects data about us has to make this
data accessible to us at all times until we decide to delete it.

## The Power of Control

We have the right to decide who gets access to our data.

Our data may be shared if and only if we give explicit consent to share
a well-defined subset of our data with a specific other entity.

This concerns data that we collect, like photo albums or emails, but
also data that is collected about us, like energy use or credit card
transactions.
